### Generic preamble
Sys.setenv(LANG = "en")

### Clean Workspace (I like to start clean)
rm(list=ls()); graphics.off() # get rid of everything in the workspace
detachAllPackages <- function() { # Also, detach packages to avoid functions masked by others
  basic.packages <- c("package:stats","package:graphics","package:grDevices","package:utils","package:datasets","package:methods","package:base")
  package.list <- search()[ifelse(unlist(gregexpr("package:",search()))==1,TRUE,FALSE)]
  package.list <- setdiff(package.list,basic.packages)
  if (length(package.list)>0)  for (package in package.list) detach(package, character.only=TRUE)
}
detachAllPackages(); rm(detachAllPackages)

### checking if all we need is installed
list.of.packages <- c("knitr", "tidyverse", "magrittr", "data.table", "skimr")

new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
rm(list.of.packages, new.packages)

### Load packages  Standard
library(knitr) # For display of the markdown
library(tidyverse) # Collection of all the good stuff like dplyr, ggplot2 ect.
library(magrittr) # For extra-piping operators (eg. %<>%)
library(data.table) # Good format to work with large datasets
library(skimr) # Nice descriptives


### Knitr options
opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE,
               message = FALSE,
               fig.align  = "center"
               )
```

Some housekeeping (again), installing necessary packages.

```{r}
list.of.packages <- c("igraph", "tidygraph", "ggraph")

new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
rm(list.of.packages, new.packages)
```


# Introduction

## Reminder: What's the deal about networks

* Looking at systems as a network often brings a fresh perspective
* It's a completely different data-concept
* By definition, things are relational, so **they somewhat depend on each others** (vs. independent observations in a dataframe)
* It's kind of messy
* But it makes pretty and impressive graphs
* It has its own rules, semantics, indicators, algorithms

## The Data Structure of Graphs

So, briefly back to the questions: Why all the fuzz with graph objects and the like?

* Tabular data
     * In tabular data, summary statistics of variables are **between observations** (column-wise) interdependent, meaning changing a value of some observation will change the corresponding variables summary statistics.
     * LIkewise, variable values might be **within observation** interdependent (row-wise), meaning changing a variable value might change summary statistics of the observation
     * Otherwise, values are (at least mathematically) independent.
* Graph data
     * Same holds true, but adittional interdependencies due to the relational structure of the data.
     * Sepperation between **node** and **edge** data, which is interdependent. Removing a node might alos impy the removal of edges, removal of edges changes the characteristics of nodes
     * In adittion, the relational structure makes that not only true for adjacent nodes and edges, but potentially multiple. Adding/Removing one node/edge could change the characteristics of every single other node/edge.
     * That is less of a problem for local network characteristics (eg., a node's degree on level 1). However, many node and edge characteristics such
     * That's mainly why graph computing is slightly more messy, and need own mathematical tools, and applications from graphical computing (graphical like graph, not like figure)

## Preperation

###  Load the data
```{r}
mat.friendship <- fread("../input/socio/ELfriend.dat", data.table = FALSE) 
mat.advice <- fread("../input/socio/ELadv.dat", data.table = FALSE) 
mat.work <- fread("../input/socio/ELwork.dat", data.table = FALSE) 
attributes <- fread("../input/socio/ELattr.dat", data.table = FALSE)
```


The three networks refer to cowork, friendship, and advice. The first 36 respondents are the partners in the firm. 

### Cleaning up

The attribute variables in the file ELattr.dat are:

* seniority status (1=partner; 2=associate)
* gender (1=man; 2=woman)
* office (1=Boston; 2=Hartford; 3=Providence)
* years with the firm
* age
* practice (1=litigation; 2=corporate)
* law school (1: harvard, yale; 2: ucon; 3: other)


```{r}
colnames(attributes) <- c("id", "seniority", "gender", "office", "tenure", "age", "practice", "school")
   
attributes %<>%
  mutate(seniority = recode(seniority, "1" = "Partner", "2" = "Associate"),
         gender = recode(gender, "1" = "Man", "2" = "Woman"),
         office = recode(office, "1" = "Boston", "2" = "Hartford", "3" = "Providence"),
         practice = recode(practice, "1" = "Litigation", "2" = "Corporate"),
         school = recode(school, "1" = "Harvard, Yale", "2" = "Ucon", "3" = "Others"))   
    
head(attributes)
skim(attributes)
```

### Descriptive Analysis

Although bibliometrics is mainly known for quantifying the scientific production and measuring its quality and impact, it is also useful for displaying and analysing the intellectual, conceptual and social structures of research as well as their evolution and dynamical aspects. 

In this way, bibliometrics aims to describe how specific disciplines, scientific domains, or research fields are structured and how they evolve over time. In other words, bibliometric methods help to map the science (so-called science mapping) and are very useful in the case of research synthesis, especially for the systematic ones.

Bibliometrics is an academic science founded on a set of statistical methods, which can be used to analyze scientific big data quantitatively and their evolution over time and discover information. Network structure is often used to model the interaction among authors, papers/documents/articles, references, keywords, etc.

Bibliometrix is an open-source software for automating the stages of data-analysis and data-visualization. After converting and uploading bibliographic data in R, Bibliometrix performs a descriptive analysis and different research-structure analysis.

Descriptive analysis provides some snapshots about the annual research development, the top "k" productive authors, papers, countries and most relevant keywords.

#### Main findings about the collection

```{r}
results <- biblioAnalysis(M)
summary(results, 
        k = 20, 
        pause = F, 
        width = 130)
```

#### Most Cited References (internally)

```{r}
CR <- citations(M, 
                field = "article", 
                sep = ";")
cbind(CR$Cited[1:10])
```

### Co-citation Analysis: The Intellectual Structure and Knowledge Bases of the field 

Citation analysis is one of the main classic techniques in bibliometrics. It shows the structure of a specific field through the linkages between nodes (e.g. authors, papers, journal), while the edges can be differently interpretated depending on the network type, that are namely co-citation, direct citation, bibliographic coupling. 

Below there are three examples.

First, a co-citation network that shows relations between cited-reference works (nodes).

Second, a co-citation network that uses cited-journals as unit of analysis.

The useful dimensions to comment the co-citation networks are: (i) centrality and peripherality of nodes, (ii) their proximity and distance, (iii) strength of ties, (iv) clusters, (iiv) bridging contributions.

Third, a historiograph is built on direct citations. It draws the intellectual linkages in a historical order. Cited works of
thousands of authors contained in a collection of published scientific articles is sufficient for recostructing the historiographic structure of the field, calling out the basic works in it.


#### Co-citation (cited references) analysis

**Plot options**:

* n = 50 (the funxtion plots the main 50 cited references)
* type = "fruchterman" (the network layout is generated using the Fruchterman-Reingold Algorithm)
* size.cex = TRUE (the size of the vertices is proportional to their degree)
* size = 20 (the max size of vertices)
* remove.multiple=FALSE (multiple edges are not removed)
* labelsize = 0.7 (defines the size of vertex labels)
* edgesize = 10 (The thickness of the edges is proportional to their strength. Edgesize defines the max value of the thickness)
* edges.min = 5 (plots only edges with a strength greater than or equal to 5)
* all other arguments assume the default values

```{r,fig.width=15,fig.height=15}
NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(M, 
                           analysis = "co-citation", 
                           network = "references", 
                           sep = ";")

net <-networkPlot(NetMatrix, 
            n = 50, 
            Title = "Co-Citation Network", 
            type = "fruchterman", 
            size.cex = TRUE, 
            size = 20, 
            remove.multiple = FALSE, 
            labelsize = 0.7,
            edgesize = 10, 
            edges.min = 5)
```

#### Cited Journal (Source) co-citation analysis

```{r,fig.width=15,fig.height=15}
M <- metaTagExtraction(M, "CR_SO", sep=";")

NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(M, 
                           analysis = "co-citation", 
                           network = "sources", 
                           sep = ";")

net <-networkPlot(NetMatrix, 
            n = 50, 
            Title = "Co-Citation Network", 
            type = "auto", 
            size.cex = TRUE, 
            size = 15, 
            remove.multiple = FALSE, 
            labelsize = 0.7,
            edgesize = 10, 
            edges.min = 5)
```

by the way, the results contain an igraph obejct

```{r}
net$graph
```

Statistics

```{r}
#netstat <- networkStat(NetMatrix)
#summary(netstat, k = 10)
```


#### Historiograph - Direct citation linkages

```{r,fig.width=15,fig.height=15}
histResults <- histNetwork(M, 
                           min.citations = quantile(M$TC,0.75), 
                           sep = ";")

net <- histPlot(histResults, 
                n = 20, 
                size.cex=TRUE, 
                size = 5, 
                labelsize = 3, 
                arrowsize = 0.5)
```



### The conceptual structure and context - Co-Word Analysis

Co-word networks show the conceptual structure, that uncovers links between concepts through term co-occurences.

Conceptual structure is often used to understand the topics covered by scholars (so-called research front) and identify what are the most important and the most recent issues.

Dividing the whole timespan in different timeslices and comparing the conceptual structures is useful to analyze the evolution of topics over time.

Bibliometrix is able to analyze keywords, but also the terms in the articles' titles and abstracts. It does it using network analysis or correspondance analysis (CA) or multiple correspondance analysis (MCA). CA and MCA visualise the conceptual structure in a two-dimensional plot.



#### Co-word Analysis through Keyword co-occurrences

**Plot options**:

* normalize = "association" (the vertex similarities are normalized using association strength)
* n = 50 (the function plots the main 50 cited references)
* type = "fruchterman" (the network layout is generated using the Fruchterman-Reingold Algorithm)
* size.cex = TRUE (the size of the vertices is proportional to their degree)
* size = 20 (the max size of the vertices) 
* remove.multiple=FALSE (multiple edges are not removed)
* labelsize = 3 (defines the max size of vertex labels)
* label.cex = TRUE (The vertex label sizes are proportional to their degree)
* edgesize = 10 (The thickness of the edges is proportional to their strength. Edgesize defines the max value of the thickness)
* label.n = 30 (Labels are plotted only for the main 30 vertices)
* edges.min = 25 (plots only edges with a strength greater than or equal to 2)
* all other arguments assume the default values

```{r Keyword co-occurrences, comment=NA, fig.height=15, fig.width=15}
NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(M, 
                           analysis = "co-occurrences", 
                           network = "keywords", 
                           sep = ";")

net <- networkPlot(NetMatrix, 
                   normalize = "association", 
                   n = 50, 
                   Title = "Keyword Co-occurrences", 
                   type = "fruchterman", 
                   size.cex = TRUE, size = 20, remove.multiple = FALSE, 
                   edgesize = 10, 
                   labelsize = 3,
                   label.cex = TRUE,
                   label.n = 50,
                   edges.min = 2)
```


#### Co-word Analysis through Correspondence Analysis

```{r}
CS <- conceptualStructure(M, 
                          method = "CA", 
                          field = "ID", 
                          minDegree = 10, 
                          k.max = 8, 
                          stemming = FALSE, 
                          labelsize = 8,
                          documents = 20)
```



#### Thematic Map

Co-word analysis draws clusters of keywords. They are considered as themes, whose density and centrality can be used in classifying themes and mapping in a two-dimensional diagram.

Thematic map is a very intuitive plot and we can analyze themes according to the quadrant in which they are placed: (1) upper-right quadrant: motor-themes; (2) lower-right quadrant: basic themes; (3) lower-left quadrant: emerging or disappearing themes; (4) upper-left quadrant: very specialized/niche themes.

```



### The social structure - Collaboration Analysis

Collaboration networks show how authors, institutions (e.g. universities or departments) and countries relate to others in a specific field of research. For example, the first figure below is a co-author network. It discovers regular study groups, hidden groups of scholars, and pivotal authors. The second figure is called "Edu collaboration network" and uncovers relevant institutions in a specific research field and their relations.

#### Author collaboration network
```{r, Au collaboration network, fig.height=15, fig.width=15}
M1 <- M %>% 
  filter(!grepl("GESCHWIND", AU))

NetMatrix <- biblioNetwork(M1, 
                           analysis = "collaboration",  
                           network = "authors", 
                           sep = ";")
